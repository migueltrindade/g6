1. Copy the entire user_force_term folder to the sites/all/modules folder or
   to a site-specific modules folder.

2. Create the vocabulary you wish to use with user_force_term. Only node
   types associated with the vocabulary are affected by the module.

3. Add some terms to the vocabulary.

4. Go to "Administer -> User management -> Users -> Force taxonomy term" and
   choose the vocabulary you just created and populated.

5. Go to "Administer -> User management -> Users" and edit the users whose
   contributions you wish to force to be associated with a term from the
   selected vocabulary.

   From the 'Term association' dropdown in the 'Account information' fieldset
   choose the term you want the user's contributions to be associated with or
   '<none>' if you don't want a forced term association.
